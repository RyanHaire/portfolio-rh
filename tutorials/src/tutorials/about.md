# About Me - Ryan Haire

## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Ryan Haire!

I started my coding journey in high school, and honestly, it wasn't easy. Finding good, beginner-friendly content was a struggle, and I often felt lost trying to teach myself how to code. But through persistence and passion, I made it through and eventually earned my **Computer Science Bachelor's Degree** after graduating high school in **2016**, as well as a **Software Engineering Advanced Diploma**.

Now, I want to **make learning to code easier** for the next generation of developers. Whether you're a high school student just starting out or a complete coding newbie looking to build your own web apps, I'm here to help! ðŸš€

## ðŸŽ¯ My Mission

- **Simplify coding education** for beginners
- **Make web app development accessible** to anyone
- **Provide hands-on, project-based learning**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you're looking to learn coding in a fun, practical way, you're in the right place! Let's build something awesome together. ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
